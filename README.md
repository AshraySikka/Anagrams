# Anagrams

This Python script checks whether two given words or phrases are **anagrams** of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another, using all original letters exactly once.

## 🧠 How It Works

- Accepts two strings as input.
- Ignores case, spaces, and punctuation.
- Sorts and compares the characters of both inputs.
- If they match, they are anagrams.

## 📁 Files

- `anagrams.py`: Main Python script that performs the check.

## ▶️ How to Run

Ensure Python is installed, then execute:

```bash
python anagrams.py
